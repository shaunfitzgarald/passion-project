# Complete List of APIs Your App Uses

Based on your codebase, here are **ALL** the APIs you need to enable for your API key:

## Required APIs (Must Have)

1. ✅ **Maps JavaScript API**
   - Used for: Displaying interactive maps
   - Location: `src/components/MapView.js`

2. ✅ **Geocoding API**
   - Used for: Converting addresses to coordinates (and vice versa)
   - Location: `src/services/geocodingService.js`
   - Functions: `geocodeAddress()`, `reverseGeocode()`

3. ✅ **Places API (New)** or **Places API**
   - Used for: Place search, autocomplete (loaded as library)
   - Location: `src/components/MapView.js` (libraries: ['places'])
   - Also used in: `src/components/AddEditLocation.js`, `src/components/BatchImport.js`

4. ✅ **Generative Language API**
   - Used for: Firebase AI Logic / Gemini AI assistant
   - Location: `src/services/geminiService.js`
   - **This is the one causing your current error!**

## Optional APIs (Recommended)

5. ⚠️ **Directions API**
   - Used for: Transit, walking, and driving directions
   - Note: Your code currently opens Google Maps URLs, but if you want to embed directions in your app, you'll need this
   - Location: `src/utils/transitUtils.js` (commented as using Directions API)

## Firebase APIs (Usually Auto-Enabled)

6. ✅ **Firebase APIs** (various)
   - Authentication API
   - Firestore API
   - Storage API
   - These are usually enabled automatically when you create a Firebase project

## Complete API Restrictions Checklist

When setting up your API key restrictions, make sure to check:

- [ ] Maps JavaScript API
- [ ] Geocoding API
- [ ] Places API (New) - **or** Places API (legacy)
- [ ] **Generative Language API** ← **CRITICAL FOR GEMINI**
- [ ] Directions API (if you want embedded directions)
- [ ] Firebase APIs (usually auto-enabled, but check if needed)

## Quick Setup Steps

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=passion-project-2eb1c

2. Click on your API key (or create a new one)

3. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"

4. Check **ALL** of these:
   - ✅ Maps JavaScript API
   - ✅ Geocoding API
   - ✅ Places API (New) - **or** Places API
   - ✅ **Generative Language API** ← **DON'T FORGET THIS ONE!**
   - ✅ Directions API (optional but recommended)

5. Click "SAVE"

6. Also make sure these APIs are **ENABLED** in the API Library:
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=passion-project-2eb1c
   - Search and enable each API if not already enabled

## Why You Need All of These

- **Maps JavaScript API**: Without this, your map won't load
- **Geocoding API**: Without this, address-to-coordinates conversion fails
- **Places API**: Without this, autocomplete and place search won't work
- **Generative Language API**: Without this, your Gemini AI assistant won't work (this is your current error!)
- **Directions API**: Without this, embedded directions won't work (though opening Google Maps URLs will still work)
