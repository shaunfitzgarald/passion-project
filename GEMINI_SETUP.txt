SETTING UP FIREBASE AI LOGIC INTEGRATION
=========================================

To enable the AI Assistant feature that auto-fills location forms:

1. ENABLE FIREBASE AI LOGIC IN YOUR PROJECT
--------------------------------------------

Since we're using Firebase AI Logic (not a direct API key), you need to:

Option A: Enable in Firebase Console
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Select your Firebase project
- Navigate to "Build" > "AI Logic" (or "AI" section)
- Enable Firebase AI Logic for your project
- This uses your existing Firebase project credentials

Option B: Enable via Google Cloud Console
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Select your Firebase project
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
- Search for "Firebase AI Logic API" or "Generative Language API"
- Click "Enable" if not already enabled

2. NO API KEY NEEDED!
---------------------

Firebase AI Logic uses your Firebase project credentials automatically.
You don't need to add any API keys to your .env file.

3. VERIFY FIREBASE CONFIG
--------------------------

Make sure your Firebase config in src/config/firebase.js is correct.
The AI Logic will use the same Firebase project.

4. RESTART DEV SERVER (if needed)
----------------------------------

If you just enabled AI Logic:
- Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
- Run: npm start

4. HOW TO USE AI ASSISTANT
---------------------------

In the "Add Location" form:
1. Click "Show AI Assistant" button at the top
2. Describe the location in natural language, for example:
   - "Add a homeless shelter at 123 Main Street, San Diego, CA. It's open 24/7 and provides meals, beds, and showers."
   - "Community food pantry at 456 Oak Ave, open Monday-Friday 9am-5pm, accepts SNAP benefits"
   - "Healthcare clinic at 789 Pine St, San Diego. Open weekdays 8am-6pm, accepts Medicaid"

3. Click the send button or press Enter
4. The AI will extract all the information and fill out the form automatically
5. Review and edit any fields as needed
6. Submit the form

The AI will intelligently:
- Extract name, address, city, state, zip code
- Determine appropriate categories and resources
- Select the best icon type
- Extract hours, phone, email, website if mentioned
- Auto-geocode the address to get coordinates

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------

If you get "API key not configured" error:
- Make sure REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY is in your .env file
- Restart the dev server after adding the key
- Check that the key doesn't have extra spaces

If AI extraction fails:
- Try rephrasing your request more clearly
- Include the address in your description
- Be specific about what type of location it is

If you get rate limit errors:
- The free tier has usage limits
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher limits
