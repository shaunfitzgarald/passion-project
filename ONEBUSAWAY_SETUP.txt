================================================

San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) provides real-time transit data through the OneBusAway API.

DOCUMENTATION:

https://www.sdmts.com/business-center/app-developers/real-time-data

GETTING AN API KEY:
-------------------
1. Visit: https://www.sdmts.com/business-center/app-developers/real-time-data
2. Fill out the "Real Time API Request" form at the bottom of the page
3. You'll need to provide:
   - Your name
   - Company/App Name (if applicable)
   - Email address
   - Project type (Commercial/Public Use App or Personal Use/School Project)
4. MTS will provide you with an API key via email

CONFIGURING THE APPLICATION:
----------------------------
1. Add the API key to your .env file:
   
   REACT_APP_ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_ONEBUSAWAY_BASE_URL=https://realtime.sdmts.com/api/api/where

2. The base URL is already configured correctly in the code, so you only need to add the API key.

NOTE ABOUT API KEYS:
--------------------
- API keys are used to track usage statistics
- All API requests should include the key parameter
- The application will work without a key for testing, but you should get one for production use

AVAILABLE FEATURES:
-------------------
Once configured, the application will:
- Show nearby bus stops when viewing a location
- Display bus stops on the map (toggleable)
- Show real-time arrival information when clicking on bus stops
- Display routes that serve each stop
- Provide bus route information near locations

GTFS REALTIME FEEDS:

MTS also provides GTFS Realtime feeds:
- Trip Updates: https://realtime.sdmts.com/api/api/gtfs_realtime/trip-updates-for-agency/MTS.pb?key=YOURKEY

These are not currently integrated but could be added for more advanced features.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If you see "API key not configured" warnings, add the key to your .env file
- If API calls fail, check that the endpoint is accessible: https://realtime.sdmts.com/api/api/where/
- The API may require CORS to be enabled on their server
- If you get 401 errors, your API key may be invalid or expired
