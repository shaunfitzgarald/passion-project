# Quick Fix for Gemini API Error

## The Problem
Your Gemini/Firebase AI Logic is failing because:
1. The Generative Language API isn't enabled, OR
2. Your API key doesn't have access to it, OR  
3. Your API key is expired/revoked

## Quick Fix Steps

### Option A: If you already created a new API key

1. **Enable Generative Language API:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=passion-project-2eb1c
   - Search for "Generative Language API"
   - Click "ENABLE"

2. **Update your API key restrictions:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=passion-project-2eb1c
   - Click on your new API key
   - Under "API restrictions", make sure **"Generative Language API"** is checked
   - Click "SAVE"

3. **Update your .env file:**
   - Make sure `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY` has your new key
   - Restart your dev server: `npm start`

### Option B: If you haven't created a new API key yet

Follow the full guide in `API_KEY_ROTATION_GUIDE.md`, but make sure to:
- ✅ Enable "Generative Language API" in API restrictions
- ✅ Enable the API in the API Library first

## Verify It Works

After enabling and updating:
1. Restart your dev server
2. Try using the AI Assistant feature
3. Check browser console for errors

If you still get errors, the API might take 1-2 minutes to propagate.
