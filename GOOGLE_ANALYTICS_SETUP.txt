SETTING UP GOOGLE ANALYTICS
============================

STEP 1: CREATE A GOOGLE ANALYTICS ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start measuring" or "Admin" > "Create Account"
4. Enter account name: "San Diego Homeless Resources"
5. Configure account settings and click "Next"

STEP 2: CREATE A PROPERTY
--------------------------
1. Enter property name: "San Diego Homeless Resources Website"
2. Select time zone: "Pacific Time (US & Canada)"
3. Select currency: "United States Dollar"
4. Click "Next"

STEP 3: CONFIGURE BUSINESS INFORMATION
---------------------------------------
1. Select industry: "Non-profit" or "Government"
2. Select business size: Choose appropriate size
3. Select business objectives: "Get baseline reports"
4. Click "Create"

STEP 4: GET YOUR MEASUREMENT ID
--------------------------------
1. After creating the property, you'll see "Data Streams"
2. Click "Add stream" > "Web"
3. Enter website URL: https://sandiegohomeless.info
4. Enter stream name: "San Diego Homeless Resources"
5. Click "Create stream"
6. Copy the "Measurement ID" (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

STEP 5: ADD MEASUREMENT ID TO YOUR PROJECT
-------------------------------------------
1. Create a .env file in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
   Note: .env files are gitignored for security

2. Add this line to your .env file:
   REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   (Replace G-XXXXXXXXXX with your actual Measurement ID)

   Example .env file contents:
   REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ABC123XYZ

3. Restart your development server:
   npm start

4. For production deployment (Firebase Hosting):
   - Add the environment variable in Firebase Console
   - Or use firebase functions:config:set
   - Or add it to your build process

STEP 6: VERIFY IT'S WORKING
----------------------------
1. Visit your website
2. Accept analytics cookies in the cookie consent banner
3. Go to Google Analytics > Reports > Realtime
4. You should see your visit appear in real-time

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Analytics will only track users who accept analytics cookies
- The cookie consent modal must be shown and accepted
- Make sure to test in an incognito/private window to see the consent modal
- Analytics data may take 24-48 hours to appear in standard reports
- Real-time reports show data immediately

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If analytics isn't working, check the browser console for errors
- Make sure REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID is set correctly in .env
- Verify the measurement ID format is correct (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
- Check that cookies are being accepted (check localStorage for 'cookieConsent')
- Make sure you've restarted the dev server after adding the .env variable
