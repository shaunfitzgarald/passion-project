IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

- Your API key is: AIzaSyC3k78W-m1QZNGj4XcE09CM6m9O7XFnkCo
- This key is used for both Firebase AND Google Maps
- Make sure Maps JavaScript API is enabled in the API restrictions
- Billing must be enabled for Google Maps (even free tier)
- After making changes, restart dev server and hard refresh browser

TEST YOUR API KEY
-----------------

Visit this URL in your browser:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyC3k78W-m1QZNGj4XcE09CM6m9O7XFnkCo&callback=initMap

If you see an error page, the API key has restrictions blocking it.
If it loads successfully, the key works but there might be a code issue.
