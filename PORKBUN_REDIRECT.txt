SETTING UP WWW REDIRECT ON PORKBUN.COM
========================================

To redirect www.sandiegohomeless.info to sandiegohomeless.info on Porkbun:

STEPS:
------

1. LOG IN TO PORKBUN
   - Go to porkbun.com and sign in

2. NAVIGATE TO DOMAIN MANAGEMENT
   - Click on "Domain Management" or "My Domains"
   - Find sandiegohomeless.info and click on it

3. SET UP URL FORWARDING
   - Look for "URL Forwarding" or "Subdomain Forwarding" section
   - Click "Add" or "Edit" next to URL Forwarding

4. CONFIGURE THE REDIRECT
   - Hostname/Subdomain: Enter "www"
   - Forward To: Enter "https://sandiegohomeless.info"
   - Type: Select "301 Permanent Redirect" (for SEO)
   - Wildcard: Leave unchecked (unless you want to forward all www subdomains)

5. SAVE THE SETTINGS
   - Click "Submit" or "Save"
   - Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

ALTERNATIVE: DNS RECORD METHOD (CNAME + FIREBASE REDIRECT)
------------------------------------------------------------
If URL Forwarding isn't available, you can use a CNAME record combined with Firebase Hosting redirect:

STEP 1: ADD CNAME RECORD IN PORKBUN
1. Go to DNS Records
2. Add a CNAME record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Host: www
   - Answer: sandiegohomeless.info
   - TTL: 300 (or default, 301 is fine too)

STEP 2: CONFIGURE FIREBASE HOSTING REDIRECT
After adding the CNAME, you need to configure the redirect in firebase.json.
The firebase.json file has been updated with the redirect rule.

IMPORTANT: The CNAME record alone does NOT create a redirect. It only makes both
www and non-www point to the same server. The actual HTTP redirect (301) is
handled by Firebase Hosting using the redirects configuration in firebase.json.

After deploying to Firebase, www.sandiegohomeless.info will automatically
redirect to sandiegohomeless.info with a 301 permanent redirect.

VERIFY
------
After setup, test by visiting:
- www.sandiegohomeless.info should redirect to sandiegohomeless.info
- The redirect should preserve the path (e.g., www.sandiegohomeless.info/about -> sandiegohomeless.info/about)
