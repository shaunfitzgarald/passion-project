HOW TO MAKE A USER AN ADMIN
============================

Option 1: Using the Admin Dashboard (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Log in as an existing admin user
2. Go to the Admin tab in the app
3. Click on "User Management" tab
4. Find the user you want to make admin
5. Change their role from "User" to "Admin" using the dropdown
6. The change is saved immediately


Option 2: Using Firebase Console (Manual)
------------------------------------------

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/passion-project-2eb1c/firestore
2. Make sure you're in the "Firestore Database" section
3. Click on the "users" collection (create it if it doesn't exist)
4. Find the user document (the document ID is the user's UID from Firebase Auth)
   - To find a user's UID: Go to Authentication → Users in Firebase Console
5. Click on the user document
6. Add or edit the "role" field:
   - Field name: "role"
   - Field value: "admin"
7. Save the document

The user will need to log out and log back in for the change to take effect.


Option 3: Create First Admin Programmatically
----------------------------------------------

If you don't have any admins yet, you can create one manually in Firestore:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Create a collection called "users" (if it doesn't exist)
3. Create a document with ID = your Firebase Auth UID
4. Add these fields:
   - email: "your-email@example.com" (string)
   - role: "admin" (string)
   - createdAt: [current timestamp]
   - updatedAt: [current timestamp]
5. Save

After this, log out and log back in, and you'll have admin access.


FINDING YOUR USER ID
--------------------

To find your Firebase Auth User ID:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/passion-project-2eb1c/authentication/users
2. Find your user account
3. Copy the "User UID" - this is what you use as the document ID in the "users" collection


ADMIN PERMISSIONS
-----------------

Once a user is an admin, they can:
- Add locations directly (no approval needed)
- Delete locations directly (no approval needed)
- Approve/reject pending location submissions
- View and manage all users
- Change user roles
